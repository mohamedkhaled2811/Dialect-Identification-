# Dialect-Identification-
This repository provides a Jupyter notebook for Arabic dialect identification using transformer-based models. It covers preprocessing of Arabic text, fine-tuning, and evaluation for classifying dialects such as Egyptian, Gulf, Iraq, Sudan, and others. The notebook utilizes pre-trained models like aubmindlab/bert-large-arabertv02-twitter and UBC-NLP/MARBERTv2.

To improve model performance, both Supervised Contrastive Loss and Cross-Entropy Loss are used during training, encouraging better representation learning and more accurate classification.
